            The main project that I show off here I created to learn more about AI through the use of Chess. I did the whole project by myself and it is my favorite and most invested project I have created.

                <p>
                This is a C# project that I did to learn more about different forms of artificial intelligence (AI). I used the classic game of Chess as my base because it shows strategy with very little randomness to it.
                I built both the Chess base and the several different forms of AI seen within the project.

                <p>
                    During my free time I practice Kali (Filipino martial art), ice skate, swing dance, and play video games.
                </p>
                <p>Kali is a Filipino martial art that I started doing. It is a casual, but deadly, style that focuses on combat using sticks. I was the President and Treasurer of the Kali Club at RIT.</p>
                <p>I also do ice skating while at RIT. I find it very fun and relaxing. Over the last three years I have used ice skating as a way to challenge myself to improve. I currently work at the Ritter Ice Arena at RIT as a rink guard and cashier.</p>
                <p>Swing dance helps me relax. It is very energy draining but it allows me to express my feelings in a nice way. I have been doing swing for two years and I am planning on continuing it into the future.</p>

            <p>
            a world of technology and humanity. Heists, Crime Families, Dictator AIs, and more await you here. The year is 2175, and American Citizens have elected an advanced Artificial Intelligence to run the country when they decided they had enough of flawed human electives.

            <p>In this system, you make characters that live and act in this world that is driven entirely by your creativity and imagination. Steal invaluable data, become the head a of a crime family, or try to take down B.I.N.F., the AI dictator of America. Anything you can imagine you can do; with a bit of skill of course.</p>
            <p>Use the unique dice system to overcome unique challenges and reap the rewards you so deserve. What you do in this world is entirely up to you; but remember: in B.I.N.F. we TRUST.</p>

            This project has thought me a lot more about teamwork and organization. The team stayed in constant communication and made sure our work got done. This is currently the biggest video game that I have worked on.

            <p>
            This game is a three to eight player evolution-themed board game that focuses on using creature abilities, movement, attacking, and defending cause mutations in the player's creature, The mutations gives the players the chance to obtain habitat tokens; once a player gets four habitate tokens and reach the end zone they win the game.

            I was the main rule maker for this project. I had to make all the rules that the players abided by, and also fixed any loopholes that were in the game. This challenged me to make the rules specific but also make it easy for players to read and understand.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            For the AI of this project, I looked into different algorithms that could be used for Chess and learned about them. Then I programmed in a way that allows them to figure out the optimal move that will give the AI the best result. There are several different types of AI that I used for this project.
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Optimal Decision Making with Uncertainty AI</u>
                        <p>This AI focuses on the idea of Optimal Decision Making. Through the use of many variables, it looks up to the next turn and determines the best move to make.</p>
                        <p>Optimal Making has three main parts:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Predicting the outcome of a decision</li>
                            <li>Assigns a value to that decision</li>
                            <li>Finds the decision that maximizes the value</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>This allows the AI to makes judgements of each possible move do the one that gives itself the greatest advantage over the opponent.</p>
                        <p>This AI is the smartest AI that I have created.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><u>Maximin/ Minimax AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning</u>
                        <p>This AI implements the minimax algorithm which makes use of Alpha-Beta pruning and Zero-sum pruning. This makes this AI a depth-first sorting algorithm.</p>
                        <p>A Maximin algorithm looks to minimize the worst possible scenario that could occur from the next player's move. This is done by looking at all possible moves that is player could make. Then it looks at all possible moves that the other player could do off that move. This will determine the worst possible combinations of moves and whichever one is the highest, that is the move that this AI will take.</p>
                        <p>This process takes a long time, especially if the AI is looking several moves ahead. Pruning is used to cut off paths that do not have any promise to them. </p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>Alpha-Beta Pruning is a search algorithm that stops completely evaluating an action when at least one possibility has been found that proves the action to be worse than a previously examined action.</li>
                            <li>Zero-sum Pruning uses the idea that the worst action for player 1 is the best action for player 2. It seeks to maximize player 1's action.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Because this algorithm uses depth-first searching, the main problem became the large amount of time that it takes to find the best possible choice. Pruning helps cut this time dramatically.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><u>Deap Learning Neural Network</u>
                            <p>This AI focuses on making a neural network over many playtests to create evolve an AI to be able to win the Chess game. The algorithm that I use for this AI is based on the paper <i>'Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies'</i> by Kenneth O. Stanley & Risto Miikkulainen.</p>
                            <p>Just like natural selection and evolution, this algorithm creates many topologies and test them. It then takes the best topologies and mates them together and also mutates them. This process is repeated until it creates a topology that is able to win the Chess game.</p>
                            <p>This AI was one of the original reasons I got into AI and I find it very interesting to study and figure out ways to make AI teach themselves to do better.</p>
                            <p>THIS HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED FULLY YET.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><u>Three Stage Chess AI</u>
                            <p>This AI is based off of the idea that in a game of Chess, there are three phases to it: the opening, the mid-game, and the end game. This AI gets separated into those three phases and does different things depending on the phase it is in.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Opening: The phase where the AI develops its' pieces, gets their king to safety, and tries to control the center of the board.</li>
                                    <li>Mid-Game: The phase where the AI attacks with and defends its' pieces.</li>
                                    <li>End Game: The phase where most pieces are off the board and the king is usually checked.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>THIS HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED FULLY YET.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><u>Variable Modifier AI</u>
                            <p>This AI is the same as the Optimal Decision Making AI, but it allows the user to change the values of the variables that the AI uses.</p>
                            <p>THIS HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED FULLY YET.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><u>Random Choice AI</u></li>
                        <p>This AI is used as a control to test other AIs in this project against. What it does is looks at all possible moves that can be made by the specific side, and choose one at random. It is meant to show that my other AIs are smarter than random. </p>

            <h3>About the Chess Base</h3>
            <p>
                It is a digitalization of the game Chess. It has all the same rules and movements as the game, from normal Bishop movements to Pawn's en passant move. It also displays all the possible moves that a selected piece can be moved to. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The most difficult part of this piece of my personal project was figuring out if a king was in check or in checkmate. This was hard because when a king was got checked, I needed to figure out if the king could move or figure out if another piece could do something that would stop the king from being taken.
                </p>
                <p>This took me about 3 weeks to create and work out all the bugs.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> 
            Depth Redemption a rogue-like game originally created in Java then ported over to Javascript with the help of Phaser.
            </p>
            <p>
            The game was first created during a 24 hour hackathon by Peter Cowal and myself. After the hackathon, I decided to take it upon myself and add more to it. I implemented several features: version history, more items, more enemies, added more to the main menu, and I modified the dungeon generator. It also contains an inventory system, leveling up, difficult levels, randomly generated dungeon floors, pre-made dungeon floors, fog of war, weapon range, and text output.
            </p>
            <p>
            Depth Redemption was the first personal project that I felt very passionate about continuing after others stopped working on it. That is why I moved it over to Javascript, so that I could continue to work on it in a language that allows for many people to play it.
