        <h3>Personal</h3>
		<p>
        I am Noah Parker, A student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying for a Bachelor of Science in Game Design and Development. I personal enjoy programming and learning about different forms of AI. I consider myself a hard worker that tries their best to complete any task given. I plan so that I can stay on top of my work. I am a quiet thinker that says what is on my mind and makes sure my point gets across.
		</p>
        <p>
        So far, I know the following programming languages: C#, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Lua.    
        </p>
        Some awards that I have receive are:
            <ul>
                <li>Eagle Scout Award, from the Boy Scouts of America on July 2nd 2014</li>
                <li>Dean's List, from Rochester Institute of Technology from Fall of 2014 till Spring of 2016</li>
                <li>Black Belt, from The Academy of Modern Martial Arts in May of 2013</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
		I come from Portland, Oregon and had lived there all my life up until I went to college. While in Oregon, I went to Jesuit High School in Portland. I love the North West and plan on living there my whole life.

        <h3>In School</h3>
		<p>
			 During my college career, I have worked on many projects from video games to data base management. Algorithms, 2D art, 3D modelling, graphic engine programming, version control, web development, and programming library creation are just some of the things that I have learned about.
        </p>

        <h3>Outside of Classes</h3>
		<p>
			During my free time I practice Kali (Filipino martial art), ice skate, swing dance, and play video games.
        </p>
        <p>Kali is a Filipino martial art that I started when I came to RIT. It is a casual, but deadly, style that focuses on combat using sticks. It teaches how to improvise and use anything at a person's disposal to defend themselves and get out of a dangerous situation. I am currently the President and Treasurer of the Kali Club at RIT and also part of the Kali wellness class that RIT offers every semester.</p>
        <p>Like Kali, I started doing ice skating when I got to RIT. I find it very fun and relaxing. Over the last three years I have used ice skating as a way to challenge myself to improve. It is a great form of exercise. I currently work at the Ritter Ice Arena at RIT as a rink guard and cashier.</p>
        <p>Swing dance helps me relax. It is very energy draining but it allows me to express my feelings in a nice way. I have been doing swing for one year so far and I am planning on continuing it after I leave college.</p>
