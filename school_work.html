                <h3>Pulp Legends</h3>
                <p>
				Pulp Legends is a 2D couch co-op, side scrolling, platformer set in the Noir/Pulp Fiction Universe. You play as Detectives with odd powers who must work together in order to solve the murder of the police chief. Traverse dark alleys, abandoned factories and the seedy underground of New Pulp and bring justice to The city once again.

                This game is a 5 week project, made in Unity, during my thrid year of college for my 'Game Design & Developement II' class. It was co-created by Anna Karwacki, Joshua Malmquist, Jason Noone, and myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This project has thought me alot more about teamwork and organization in a project. As a team we stay in constint communication as well as make sure we are getting our work done on time that we as a team decide. This is currently the biggest video game that I have worked on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It currently still being made.

            <h3>What I Did For This Project</h3>
                For this project I am Lead Programmer. I worked on the code for the world controller, enemies, camera controls, and Pulp Powers. I also deligated other pieces of code like the player class, basic objects, menu controls, and charater selection to other members of the team.

				It the survival of the weirdest. This project was created in my second year of college by 5 other people and myself in our 'Game Design & Developement I' class. It is a board based around the idea of evolution, adaptations, and mutations.
				</p>
				<p>
				This game is a three to eight player evolution-themed board game that focuses on using creature abilities, movement, attacking, and defending in order to get certain cards that trigger events, cause mutations in the player's creature, or give the player special adaptability in certain habitats on the board. The adaptability gives the players the chance to obtain habitat tokens; once a player gets four zone tokens and reach the end zone they win the game. 
				</p>
                <img src="images/zoo_board2.jpg" title="Unnatural Selection Board" alt="Unnatural Selection" width="312" height="195"/>
				<p>
				The three initial ideas were a game based solely on random environment changes and the ability to adapt to them, a game that was based on achieving adaptability to different zones on one mainland, where each subsequent zone was more difficult to adapt to, and our current game. We picked our current idea because it allowed for more player interaction than the other two and was easier to add certain aspects of the other two ideas without totally changing the game.

                <p>
                I was the main rule maker for this project. I had to make all the rules that the players abided by, and also fixed any loopholes that were in the game. This challenged me to make the rules specific but also make it easy for players to read and understand.

				<h3>Feed The Masses</h3>
				<p>
				This project is a tower defence game that was co-created by Josh McMahan, Alia Gestl, and myself in my first year of college for our 10 week project in your 'Game Dev & Algo Prob Solve II' class. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The project was our first major group that we had to do for class. It tought about working as a group and how to keep code in order while multiple people are writing it. It also made each member problem solve so that we could reach each milestone. Finally it also tought us how to manage time in a big project over many weeks so that we can meet deadlines.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the realm of programming, I gained several skills from the project. One skill I learned was how to use trigonometry, pi, and other things
				related to those things in code and make them work. Anothering I learned was how to fix bugs in a reasonable amount of time. Something that I
				learned was that "code is dumb", this means that code can be very annoying and bad, but it can also be very useful if implemented correctly.

                I was the Lead Programmer of this game. I created the tower aiming, the phase structure, and how a player is allowed to place towers on the field.
