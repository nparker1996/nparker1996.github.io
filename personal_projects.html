				<h3>Game Basic Library</h3>
				<p>
				This library was originally created by Peter Cowal in Java. I have decided to convert it to C#. It is a libray that allows for 
				easier creation of games using forms and percise manipulations of the pixels in the game or simulations.
				</p>
				<p>
				I decided to recreate the Java version in C# because back in high school it was really helpful for me making games in Java.
				I've been learning the differences and similarities between Java and C#. I have also been learning different small pieces
				of code that can help me if I ever make another library in C# or another langauge.

				<h3>The Abomination Project</h3>
				<p>
				This project is was originally created by a high school friend named Peter Cowal and me. 
				It was orignally coded in Java and currently am in the process of converting it to c#. It implements the GameBasic Library.
				</p>
				<p>
				Originally, this game was made at a 24 hour hachaton by Peter and me. After the hackathon, I decided to take it upon myself and add more
				to it. I implemented things like version history, more items, more enemies, added more to the main menu,
				and I modified the dungeon generator. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The I primarily liked about it was that it was really my first game that I felt very passionate about continuing after others stopped
				working on it. That is why I am moving it over to C# so I can continue working on it in my spare time.
